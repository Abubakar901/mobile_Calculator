# mobile_Calculator

Basic Calculator in Mobile Layout with Resposive Design.

For HTML plate, I have created some container divs and added multiple buttons inside it.

For CSS, I used different properties like border-radius, position, margin, background color,
padding, font-size, color,etc then I align them in a mobile container by giving different properties.

For taking input from user using buttons, 
I have used input tag and I added an event listener on button and i created an loop 
which will check conditions and will perform calculations on it.

For divide and multiply, I had to add an loop for checking conditions and
give them the proper symbol for multiply and divide.

For Clear I used the number on screen divide by 10, i.e 25675 -> 2567.5
then I parse it in Int so the number after decimal won't be calculated.

For All Clear, I just added an empty string so it can make the input empty again.
